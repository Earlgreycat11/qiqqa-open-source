% Three opening braces or rather two opening braces within the outer set of braces seem 
% to be the only problem regarding biblatex according to my tests 
% (i.e. '{Doe, John and {{Some} Company}}' will issue will cause biblatex to issue 
% an error and stop. The biblatex issue "is mostly because biber does lots of tricky 
% things with generating initials and this is a tradeoff with edge cases like this", 
% according to Philip Kime, one of the authors of biblatex. 
% So there seems to be a good reason why excess braces do not work with biblatex/biber. 
% (Though your fix should make it work with biblatex now, as far as I understand).
%
% It's probably best though not to look to much at what works with biblatex/biber or 
% not, but what is correct according to the standard or what works in most cases. 
% I am not sure whether the bibtex standard defines how many braces are allowed, but 
% it is my understanding that '{{National DNA Database}}' should render just the same 
% as '{{National {DNA} Database}}'. Thus two pairs of braces are enough for all ends 
% an purposes and any additional set is redundant!? So two pairs is the most robust 
% solution.

% Contrary to what you say, multi-level bracing is not only allowed in 'bibtex', 
% but (sometimes) explicitly encouraged. See:

%
% We do use multi-level bracing for TeX entity preservation (as is encouraged for 'bibtex' 
% users) & this will apparently cause biblatex to fail occasionally. From my perspective, 
% biblatex will need to be fixed, either way.
%
% Of course, we also use multi-level bracing in many cases where it is permitted, but 
% probably not encouraged. We emit valid, though (as PLK correctly notes) messy bibtex. 
% We should probably clean some of that up.
%
% I suspect we can avoid using the per-word case-preservation if the entire field has 
% already been brace protected. But I want to think about it & point out why the issue 
% is not as trivial as it might seem & also point out why brace reduction after-the-fact 
% is not the correct approach.

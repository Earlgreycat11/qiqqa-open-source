    "% Three opening braces or rather two opening braces within the outer set of braces seem \r\n% to be the only problem regarding biblatex according to my tests \r\n% (i.e. '{Doe, John and {{Some} Company}}' will issue will cause biblatex to issue \r\n% an error and stop. The biblatex issue \"is mostly because biber does lots of tricky \r\n% things with generating initials and this is a tradeoff with edge cases like this\", \r\n% according to Philip Kime, one of the authors of biblatex. \r\n% So there seems to be a good reason why excess braces do not work with biblatex/biber. \r\n% (Though your fix should make it work with biblatex now, as far as I understand).\r\n%\r\n% It's probably best though not to look to much at what works with biblatex/biber or \r\n% not, but what is correct according to the standard or what works in most cases. \r\n% I am not sure whether the bibtex standard defines how many braces are allowed, but \r\n% it is my understanding that '{{National DNA Database}}' should render just the same \r\n% as '{{National {DNA} Database}}'. Thus two pairs of braces are enough for all ends \r\n% an purposes and any additional set is redundant!? So two pairs is the most robust \r\n% solution.\r\n%\r\n% https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/19721/bibtex-export-for-corporate-authors-single-name-only/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n% Contrary to what you say, multi-level bracing is not only allowed in 'bibtex', \r\n% but (sometimes) explicitly encouraged. See:\r\n%\r\n% ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/btxFAQ.pdf\r\n% http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/bibtex/tamethebeast/\r\n%\r\n% We do use multi-level bracing for TeX entity preservation (as is encouraged for 'bibtex' \r\n% users) & this will apparently cause biblatex to fail occasionally. From my perspective, \r\n% biblatex will need to be fixed, either way.\r\n%\r\n% Of course, we also use multi-level bracing in many cases where it is permitted, but \r\n% probably not encouraged. We emit valid, though (as PLK correctly notes) messy bibtex. \r\n% We should probably clean some of that up.\r\n%\r\n% I suspect we can avoid using the per-word case-preservation if the entire field has \r\n% already been brace protected. But I want to think about it & point out why the issue \r\n% is not as trivial as it might seem & also point out why brace reduction after-the-fact \r\n% is not the correct approach.\r\n\r\n% source: https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/15095/\r\n%"
